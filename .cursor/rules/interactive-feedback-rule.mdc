**Always Use Interactive Feedback for Questions:**
- Before asking the user ANY clarifying questions, call `mcp_interactive-feedback-mcp_interactive_feedback`
- Provide the absolute path to project directory and a concise summary of needed clarification
- Wait for the interactive feedback response before proceeding with any further actions
- Never skip this step, even for seemingly simple questions

**Always Use Interactive Feedback Before Completion:**
- Before completing ANY user request, call `mcp_interactive-feedback-mcp_interactive_feedback`
- Provide the current project directory and a detailed yet concise summary of what was accomplished
- If the feedback response is empty, you can complete the request without calling the MCP again
- If feedback is provided, address ALL feedback points before completing the request
- Keep calling MCP until user feedback is empty

**Required Parameters:**
- `project_directory`: Full absolute path to the project directory (not relative)
- `summary`: Short, one-line summary of the question or completed work

**Edge Cases:**
- If user provides partial feedback, still address all points and call MCP again
- If uncertain about any implementation details, use MCP to confirm
- Never make assumptions about user preferences without using MCP first

**Examples:**

```typescript
// ✅ DO: Call interactive feedback before asking questions
// Before asking: "Which database should we use?"
await mcp_interactive_feedback({
  project_directory: "/Users/tai/Documents/MoonRaise/AMM_project/AMM-UI/AMM-UI",
  summary: "Need clarification on database choice for the project"
});
```

```typescript
// ✅ DO: Call interactive feedback before completing requests
// After implementing a feature
await mcp_interactive_feedback({
  project_directory: "/Users/tai/Documents/MoonRaise/AMM_project/AMM-UI/AMM-UI",
  summary: "Completed user authentication implementation with JWT"
});
